TODO
====

All contributions, no matter how small, would be greatly appreciated (as long as they're obviously useful, of course). The points below describe code I plan to write, eventually, if someone doesn't write it for me. So, if you see something that you would like to tackle, let me know, and I'll wait for your patch.

* Minimize blit operations to improve update efficiency ("dirty rect" concept, more or less, but not if it makes the API too complex).
* A few additional "mini games" for the demos directory.
